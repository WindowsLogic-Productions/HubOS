# About HubOS
Hub OS was an application which allowed you to replace your desktop with an overlay with useful tools and a framework to access all things Windows. Many of the features in HubOS were ported over to [WLP Hub](https://github.com/windowslogic/wlp-hub), because it is no longer needed, it is achived.
